#Code from MTRN3500 Assignment 1 - Computing Applications in Mechatronic Systems

This assignment required software for to be developed for three hardware interface cards:
1. PCM-3718 multi-function interface card
2. PC104-DAC06 analog output card
3. MSI-P404 encoder input card
Once the modules had been developed they had to be used to receive data from multiple inputs such as a bank of DIP switches, a rotary encoder and analog voltage input. Possible outputs included digital outputs on specific bits or bytes or a varied analog voltage. Several operators also required overloading to complete specific tasks.
